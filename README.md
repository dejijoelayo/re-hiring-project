# Cox Automotive / Manheim Release Engineering Hiring Project
Manheim's Release Engineering team develops tools, libraries, documentation, and processes to allow seventy development teams to do their jobs faster and more efficiently, reliably, and securely. Each of the teams is autonomous and has full control over the choice of languages and tools that they use. When they choose ours, it's because we provided the most compelling solution. When we do our jobs well, our products are also adopted by some of the hundreds of Cox Automotive development teams outside of the Manheim business unit.

We don't do whiteboarding or programming exercises in our interviews. Our interviews are a conversation about you, about us and our company, about your experience, and about how well we think you'd be a fit for us and vice-versa. This project is intended as a way for you to show us your technical skills in a self-paced, low-pressure environment. It is intended to take no more than a few hours to complete. After a few hours, if you have not completed the challenge, wrap up your work and deliver it to us with your plan so we understand your vision for how you’d complete the project if you had the time.

__Before you start:__ _If you’ve created some code that shows your experience and capabilities, feel free to submit that instead of completing this challenge.  Our intent is to see your coding ability and style to see if you’re qualified for the job._

## The Challenge:

A new development team is tasked with creating a web based visualization tool. You are tasked with writing code to deploy the application that will eventually be added to a pipeline, but the application is not done yet, so you’ll use “hello world” as a placeholder. Anyone on the team must be able to maintain and execute the deployment code.  

### Requirements:

* Display the text “hello world” in a browser
* Create the deploy code that will be used in the pipeline for a single environment
* Make it generic so it can be deployed to multiple environments [dev & prod initially, but eventually others]
* Must be capable of completely tearing down deployed environments
* Use language[s] you prefer
* Use the cloud provider, tools, and technologies you prefer
* Use git to store your code. fork this repository or clone it
* Deliver the code to us via fork link or gzipped tar ball including the .git directory so we can see all commits

### Suggestions:

* Use a free tier of your cloud provider so we can run your code, aws preferred
* Instructions should be complete and clear
* Don’t reinvent the wheel
* Commit often and don't squash commits
* Don’t spend more than a few hours on the challenge. If some requirements could not be completed, let us know why.
